# IRA 🚀  
**Cyber Incident Management Reimagined**  

If you are worried about leading or supporting a major cyber incident, **IRA (Intelligent Root-cause Analyzer)** is the tool and approach you need. Designed for the high-pressure environment of **Cyber Incident Management**, IRA focuses on the **non-technical challenges** faced by leaders, helping you and your team respond effectively and decisively.  

## 🌟 Why IRA?  
When a cyber incident strikes, technical teams focus on detecting, analyzing, and neutralizing the attackers. However, maximizing their effectiveness requires **clear communication**, **effective management**, and **focused tasking**. IRA bridges the gap between leadership and technical response teams by:  

- Ensuring the team stays focused on **remediating the incident**.
