# IRA 🚀  
**Cyber Incident Management Reimagined**  

If you are worried about leading or supporting a major cyber incident, **IRA (Intelligent Root-cause Analyzer)** is the tool and approach you need. Designed for the high-pressure environment of **Cyber Incident Management**, IRA focuses on the **non-technical challenges** faced by leaders, helping you and your team respond effectively and decisively.  

# TL;DR 
Here's a report produced by agent: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTMmT84Ts8VQrEXvms3r_dIacgGtxqtK2p6wlqj3lThP8yD6LkEnz_gBhK3dIk0vmqDoHJQLje9_v8r/pub

## 🌟 Why IRA?  
When a cyber incident strikes, technical teams focus on detecting, analyzing, and neutralizing the attackers. However, maximizing their effectiveness requires **clear communication**, **effective management**, and **focused tasking**. IRA bridges the gap between leadership and technical response teams by:  

- Ensuring the team stays focused on **remediating the incident**.  
- Helping leaders **distill critical data** for decision-making and concise briefings.  
- Providing structured frameworks for managing teams under extreme pressure.  
- Facilitating seamless communication from hands-on teams to executives and boards.  

IRA empowers teams to work like **investigative journalists**, pinpointing attackers with speed and precision, and enhances communication at all levels to ensure a coordinated response.
