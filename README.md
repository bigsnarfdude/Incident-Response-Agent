Memory analysis in forensics, also known as memory forensics or live analysis, focuses on capturing and analyzing a computer's memory (RAM) to uncover digital artifacts and evidence of malicious activity. This is crucial because many advanced threats operate solely in memory, leaving little to no footprint on the hard drive. By analyzing memory, forensic analysts can identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that can be used to detect other compromised devices. 

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) in incident response are specific pieces of digital evidence that indicate a system may have been compromised. They are used to identify and respond to security incidents. IoCs can be catalogued and used for threat hunting and incident response.
